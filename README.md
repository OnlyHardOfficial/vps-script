# vps-script

I was reading some thread on LET about what is the easiest panel installation, and I was also reading some guy signature about plexdrive(?). I was thinking I should made some 1 line easy installer.

So I decided to post this.

##Centos 7

| Centos Web Panel | : | `bash < (curl -s centos7.panel.web.id/cwp/)`        |
| VestaCP          | : | `bash < (curl -s centos7.panel.web.id/vestacp/)`    |
| Lemp Stack       | : | `bash < (curl -s centos7.panel.web.id/lemp/)`       |
| Kloxo - MR       | : | `bash < (curl -s centos7.panel.web.id/kloxomr/)`    |
| OpenVPN          | : | `bash < (curl -s centos7.panel.web.id/openvpn/)`    |
| Virtualmin       | : | `bash < (curl -s centos7.panel.web.id/virtualmin/)` |

I will probably adding more script in the future. If you have any useful script you want to add to my website, feel free to contact me.
